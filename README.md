# Exercise6.jl

 This repository contains an example solution for Exercise 6 of the course Modelling and Machine Learning of Dynamical Systems in Julia at TUM. Here we implement a number of compartmental models and analyze them.
 
 See the notebook [Exercise6.ipynb](https://github.com/maximilian-gelbrecht/Exercise6.jl/blob/main/Exercise6.ipynb) for an analysis of the models defined in this package.
